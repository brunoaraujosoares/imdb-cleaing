# IMDB Data Cleaning with SQL

This project demonstrates a full **data cleaning workflow** on the IMDB Kaggle dataset using PostgreSQL.  
It focuses on transforming messy raw data into a **structured, analysis-ready format** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling.

## Highlights
- Modular SQL pipeline (each stage in its own `.sql` file).
- Standardized data types and validated value ranges.
- Handling of missing and inconsistent data.
- Relational modeling of directors and actors.
- Data dictionary for full transparency.

## TODO
- Single `main.sql` to run the entire pipeline.
- Include 'functions.sql' in the other SQL scripts where functions are needed.
- Instead of replacing certificates values, create a map table with the normalized data;
- Look for non alphabetic characters in text fields;
- Validate if gross and no_of_votes have values ​​consistent with the year.

## Why this project?
It showcases **practical data engineering + data science skills**:  
- SQL for cleaning, standardization, and normalization.  
- Documentation and reproducibility for real-world datasets.  
- A foundation for further analysis, visualization, or machine learning.
